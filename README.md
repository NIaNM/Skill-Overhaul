# Overview
An attempt to rebalance skills in PAYDAY 2.

##Features
This mod introduces some changes to the skilltrees.

######Mastermind
* Dominator Ace now gives you a small chance to dominate enemies by aiming at them. Higher threat stats on your weapon will increase this chance.
* Stockholm Syndrome now allows tied civilians to revive you.
* Stockholm Syndrome now allows converts to revive you.
* Stockholm Syndrome Basic now makes the first bullet to hit a civilian harmless (like melee).
* Stockholm Syndrome Ace spawns 5 ammo pickups, rather than 1.
* Partner in Crime Basic now gives you two converts instead of one.
* Inspire Ace now has a 50% chance to revive people, instead of 75%.

######Enforcer
* Shotgun CQB Ace now increases shotgun fire rate by 50%.
* Oppressor Ace now gives all weapons a 5% panic chance.
* Hard Boiled Basic now gives 8 more accuracy to all weapons when firing from the hip.
* Hard Boiled Ace now gives 25% more reload speed and 20% more damage to LMG's.
* Overkill Ace now gives a 20% damage resistance on kill.
* Tough Guy Ace now increases your bleedout health by 150%.

######Technician
* The amount of tripmines is increased 2x (max. tripmines is now 12).
* To offset the unbalance with shaped charges, shaped charges now cost 2 tripmines to place. Hopefully this will make tripmines as actual mines more valuable.

* Jack of All Trades and Mag Plus have been switched.
* Sentries will no longer target shields and other things they can't see.

######Ghost
* Moving Target now increases movement speed based on your detection risk.
* Nine Lives Ace now additionally guarantees a self-revive on your first down.
* SMG Specialist gives a 20% damage boost to SMG's (credit to SC).

######Fugitive
* Daredevil has been replaced with Moving Target. Basic version gives the old Daredevil Basic+Ace effects, Ace allows sprinting in any direction.
* Brother's Keeper has been merged into Brother's Keeper Basic.
* Brother's Keeper Ace now gives a 20% chance for your first aid kits to restore a down.
* Trigger Happy now works with Akimbos.
 
######Perk Decks
* The first perk in Rogue and Crook (Subtle) now increases your dodge chance by 10% again, instead of 5%.
* Ex-President's health bar will only be depleted if it actually heals you.
* Muscle no longer causes panic. The chance has been lowered to 5% and moved to Oppressor Ace.

More to come.
