# Overview
An attempt to rebalance skills in PAYDAY 2.

##Features
This mod introduces some changes to the skilltrees.

######Mastermind
* Stockholm Syndrome Basic now makes the first bullet to hit a civilian harmless (like melee).
* Stockholm Syndrome Ace spawns 5 ammo pickups, rather than 1.

######Technician
* The amount of tripmines is increased 2x (max. tripmines is now 12).
* To offset the unbalance with shaped charges, shaped charges now cost 2 tripmines to place. Hopefully this will make tripmines as actual mines more valuable.
* Shaped Charges Basic and Aced have been switched.
* Shockproof Ace now electrifies your bullets while you're being tased, tasing any enemies you hit.

######Fugitive
* Daredevil has been replaced with Moving Target. Basic version gives the old Daredevil Basic+Ace effects, Ace allows sprinting in any direction.

More to come.
